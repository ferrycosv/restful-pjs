# RESTFUL-PJS: development strategy

---

## 0. Setup

- copied all content of previous project `practical javascript` and made sure it runs ok from the `/public` folder.

## 1. User Story: `Add todo`

- The existing functionality must be refactored to fetch the information from a server.
- I wrote the code in `data/todoList.js` changed the `addTodo` and `displayTodos` functions to interact with the REST API server using asynchronous fetch calls and processing the result object.
